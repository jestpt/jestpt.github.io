Python is a versatile and commonplace programming language employed in a large number of situations. For this regard, Python has an ever growing plethora of libraries and tools for machine learning and data science development and appliance that allow the tackling of big data as well as applications in numerous scientific, marketing and many other fields.
The workshop data_science.py will take place at University of Coimbra's Life Sciences Department, totalling 18 hours of formation along four days comprised into three modules, between 18h30 and 21h00:

**Module I** - Introducing python - 17th and 19th of April, 2017:
