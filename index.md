At an individual level, JEST members have ambitious goals. However, this is the fuel that drives the collective purpose as it was previously described. With an environment of equality and personal features optimization, JEST sets its tone as an original junior enterprise aiming at putting science through a data perspective as well as adding a science perspective to data.</p>
